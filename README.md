# telegram_bot_hashtags
The bot creates hashtags for user's texts in *Russian* and *English*. 

It is a simple bot for creating hashtags.

**NOTE**

file config.py contains variables TOKEN and URL_APP. These variables should be added by yourself, otherwise the bot will not work. 
You can find the token asking *BotFather*. URL_APP is a url of your bot, uploaded at a server. I use Heroku for this.

**PLANS**

the bot can be improved, that I'm planning to do:
1) add a database for collecting likes and dislikes
2) improve keyword-extraction algorithm (espacially bringing to a normal form)
